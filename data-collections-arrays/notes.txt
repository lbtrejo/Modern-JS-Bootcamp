Creating Arrays
====================

let arrayExample = new Array(item, item2, item3, etc...) 
let arrayEx2 = [];

Arrays are mutable.
Like underwear, can change often.


Array Methods
==========

Push - add values to the end of the array
Pop - remove the last value in the array
Shift - remove value from the beginning of the array
Unshift - add value to the beginning of the array

You can push/unshift multiple values in a single method.
Pushing multiples works as expected.
Unshifting multiples places the new items at the beginning array IN THE ORDER THEY EXIST in the method args


concat - Merge Arrays
includes - look for a value in the array // returns bool, exact match
indexOf - functions exactly the same as str.indexOf()
join - creates a string from an array

reverse - reverses the items in the array (last becomes first,...)
// ^ mutates the original array 

slice - copy a portion of an array
splice - remove/replace array elements
sort - sorts an array 


Reference Types
====================
Value type variable used for storing primitive types.  When these are stored in memory the actual value is stored in the memory "slot"

Reference type variable.  Think of Java's variable storage.  Everything is a reference to an object in memory.
Arrays are an example of this.  The reference is stored in memory.  Anything else assigned to the array name would reference that same object in memory.
